# Enterprise AI Adoption Playbook

This repository documents **practical patterns, decision frameworks and lessons learned**
from adopting Artificial Intelligence in **enterprise and regulated environments**.

This is not a framework.  
This is not a reference implementation.  

It is a **playbook for decision-making**.

---

## What this playbook is about

AI adoption fails far more often due to **organizational, architectural and governance issues**
than because of model quality or tooling.

This playbook focuses on:
- how organizations decide to adopt AI
- where AI actually creates value
- what breaks when AI meets real systems
- how to measure success beyond demos

---

## Core questions this playbook addresses

- Who owns AI systems once they are in production?
- How does AI integrate with existing APIs and workflows?
- How do you define success metrics that are not vanity?
- Where does security, compliance and risk management fit?
- When should AI *not* be deployed?

## Adoption layers

### 1. Business & Value
- Problem selection vs. solution bias
- ROI definition and value hypotheses
- Stakeholder alignment

### 2. Architecture & Integration
- API-first vs. AI-first thinking
- Latency, cost and reliability constraints
- RAG, agents and orchestration trade-offs

### 3. Security & Governance
- Authentication and identity
- Data boundaries and leakage risks
- Compliance and auditability

### 4. Operations & Ownership
- Monitoring and observability
- Model drift and behavior changes
- Incident response and rollback strategies

---

## Common misconceptions

- “AI adoption is a tooling problem”
- “LLMs replace existing systems”
- “Proofs of concept validate production readiness”
- “Accuracy is the primary success metric”

---

## Intended audience

- Solutions Architects
- Pre-Sales and Customer Success Engineers
- Platform and Product leaders
- Engineering managers involved in AI initiatives

---

This playbook is intentionally **opinionated**, based on real-world constraints.

Clarity over complexity.  
Execution over noise.
